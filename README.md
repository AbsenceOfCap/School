User needs can be fulfilled by making user stories and using those to create key features in a program. Just imagine that you are the user and just state things you would like to be able to do with a given software. For our travel program, I stated things like "I want to be able to set a maximum budget" and things similar to that with every key feature I wanted to add.
In order to approach developing programs you must first ask how long development will take, and how flexible the project needs to be, then choose the method most appropriate between waterfall and agile. Simple development with minimal creativity would be waterfall, and complexity and need to be flexible would require the agile approach. Agile tools that could be used are things like splitting up the development into sections and doing things like creating user stories to add key features are things I hope to implement in my future career.
A good team member is someone who is contributing to the project, giving their best effort, and having great communication with the team. Giving effort is important for everyone in any field, but communication in a team of developers is very necessary as it allows team members to know where each person stands in regards to strengths and weaknessess allowing for the most efficient path to completion.
